Introduction
------------
This is a basic Java program which converts text (currently just english alphabet) into ASCII art.

Requirements
------------
Java Development Toolkit (1.6 or higher/OpenJDK works as well)

How to use
----------
Although the .class file should work with you, but it you dont want to use mine (you frankly shouldn't, direct executables on the internet should never be opened) 

Compile Java Program
--------------------
=>On Windows:
-------------
1. Open command prompt and type
	path="PATH TO JDK FOLDER"
	eg: 	path="C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7/bin/" [This is just a sample guess, but it should be more or less the same for you as well]
2. 	cd PathOfMyGit
3. 	javac ASCII.java

=>On Linux/Mac:
---------------
Follow 2 and 3 of Windows :)

Run Java Program:
-----------------
Assuming you already have compiled (and in case of windows, set path), run
	java ASCII "String"
	eg:	java ASCII "This is a test string"
